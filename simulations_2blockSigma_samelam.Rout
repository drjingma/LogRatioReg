> # Purpose: Simulate data from balance regression model to compare
> #   compositional lasso and supervised log-ratios methods
> # Note: Here, we simulate from a 2-block-diagonal Sigma and intend to:
> #   - have one active contrast corresponding to the two blocks, so that 
> #       slr correctly specifies the log-ratio formed by the 2 blocks
