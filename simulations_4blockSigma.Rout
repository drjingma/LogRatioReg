> # Purpose: Simulate data from balance regression model to compare
> #   compositional lasso and supervised log-ratios methods
> # Note: Here, we simulate from a 2-block-diagonal Sigma and intend to:
> #   - have one active contrast corresponding to 2 of the 4 blocks, so that 
> #       slr correctly specifies the log-ratio formed by the 2 blocks --
> #       compare this to the results from simulations_2blockSigma.R with the 
> #       dense setting, which has the same structure (1 contrast containing 2 
> #       active blocks), but no inactive set.
